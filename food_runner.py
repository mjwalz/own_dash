We need to provide data -
like from `food_runner_data.py` is coming,
but data is local so we need to provide a default
which will be updated
    - update_dict
    - so it will be changed in version control (VC)
    - but not all the data hangling functions -

From projects/{{ name }}/data we will just get the result for an Visualization
 We don't want to waste space for data handling and also not in the resources.
 Maybe check Lambda Functions
 and yea test will be done on the data site
 Maybe an import test of the default data


 For sunburst we need a typical data structure: check it in the `README.md`
