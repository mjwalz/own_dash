# simple rick


# CREATED
```python
f'{name}'.py  # infrastructure for the following files
f'{name}_data'.py  # prepare the data so it fits in the app structure
f'{name}_app'.py  # run visual app with it
```
### test it with `python food_runner_app.py`
of course after you `source`d the `.venv/bin/activate` in which you will
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.

# TODO
- [X] let somehow a program read the apps in and hanDle, give it as a html to the browser
- more or less...
- [x] and yea. it is with TABS...
<<<<<<< HEAD
- [ ] prepare an easy django read in :-1:
---

- [ ] ah yea. the data hdanling is still local :+1:
=======
- [ ] maybe put some apps with two files in each folder... I just mean Ã¤h. many files though

# CREATED 
{name}.py  # infrastructure for the following files
{name}_data.py  # prepare the data so it fits in the app structure
{name}_app.py  # run visual app with it

### test it with food_runner_app.py
### dont forget to `pip install -r requirements.txt`in a `source .venv/bin/activate` a.k.a `virtualenv .venv` oder `python3 -m venv .venv`
